				<h2>Testimonials</h2>
				<p>“I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the mediation services recently provided by Alternative Resolutions.  As you are of course aware, the stakes in the involved dispute were significant, with two of our respected physicians moving rapidly toward a likely “partnership divorce”.  The issues between the two had festered over the course of many years and threatened to disrupt one of our most valuable and productive surgical departments.  The resultant fallout to the system, the involved clinicians and their families, and to the community we serve would have been significant. <br/>

				Having discussed the (mediation) experience with the involved physicians, it’s clear that they’ve made great strides in their comfort level and communication tendencies with each other.  The behavioral agreement they constructed and signed provides a solid framework within which improved communication will very positively impact the quality of care they are able to provide to their mutual patients.”
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>“Thank you so much for your care and consideration throughout this (mediation) process. This was my first experience with mediation and I thought you did an outstanding job of making sure everyone was heard. Your professionalism was astounding and we could not have asked for a better leader. Thank you so much for your time. Perhaps we will work together in the future.”</p>
				<br/>
				<p>“The mediation session was unlike any other mediation session I attended.  The parties remained in the same room while the mediator truly facilitated a discussion about the issues.  As a result of that discussion, my client ultimately received an apology from her employer.  Because that acknowledgement of responsibility and apology were so important to my client, resolving the remaining issues went very quickly.  
				<br/>
				I am convinced that this case settled only as a result of the mediator’s ability to facilitate a discussion in order to address the factual and emotional issues.  It is highly unlikely that this case would have settled utilizing any other method.”</p>
