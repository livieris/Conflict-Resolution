## Getting Started
1. To get started, open the sql file and dump that into your database. It has everything you need to create the tables and fill in the information if need be. If you just want empty tables, then only use the 'create table' statements. Once database is set up, download the source code and open it.
2. Once the source code is opened, go ahead and replace the following $db information on all of the following pages

```
$db_hostname = 'localhost';
$db_database = 'dbname';  (The name of the database)
$db_username = 'username'; (Your username for the database)
$db_password = 'dbpassword'; (Your password for the database)

```
