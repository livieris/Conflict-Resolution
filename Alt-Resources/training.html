				<h2>Negotiate Your Way To Success: Achieve Win-Win Outcomes</h2>
				<p>Negotiation is the basic means we use to get what we want from others.  However, getting what you want isn’t the only consideration--you also have to get along with people.  Therefore, much negotiation involves an attempted trade-off between holding out for what you want regardless of how it affects relationships (hard negotiating) and making any concessions in order to reach an amicable solution (soft negotiating).  This workshop introduces participants to a method of negotiating that is both hard and soft.  Participants learn tools and techniques for working with others to resolve issues in a way that both supports relationships and looks for win-win solutions that everyone can live with.</p>
				<p>In this informative seminar participants will:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Identify several types of negotiation</li>
					<li>Understand the negotiation strategy best suited for business relationships</li>
					<li>Utilize a tool to plan for any negotiation</li>
					<li>Learn tips for successful negotiation</li>
					<li>Discover the interests underneath positional bargaining</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Attendees will leave with tools and techniques for getting what you want and need without giving in or giving up.</p>
