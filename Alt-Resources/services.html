				<p>Mediation provides a unique intervention approach to conflict resolution in which conflict is viewed as an opportunity for growth and change.  Participants themselves define the conflict and create the solutions.</p>  
				<p>Mediation is a voluntary process in which parties choose to work together with an impartial third party (mediator) to resolve their conflict in a mutually beneficial way.  It is a confidential, uniquely flexible process that can be tailored to meet a wide variety of situations.</p>
				<p>Because people in conflict are understandably defensive and self-absorbed in protecting their own interests, communication becomes difficult.  Mediation provides the opportunity for each person to clearly and effectively communicate their concerns and needs, and to develop an understanding of another party’s perspective.  Mediation is effective because it goes beyond what appears to be the problem, to address the root of the problem.</p>
				<p>Parties in mediation are encouraged to recognize that they have within themselves the ability to deal positively with the conflict because they know better than anyone what they need for resolution.  Through the process, parties will identify and develop their own resources and strategies to address both substantive and relational issues.  Decision-making power is in the hands of those most closely involved with the situation; those who will live the outcome, rather than a third party.</p>
				<p>Rather than focus on the harms of the past, mediation focuses on the opportunities of the future.  Because mediation fosters an environment of respect and trust, participants are able to maintain dignity throughout the entire process. Mediation humanizes a dispute in a way that an adversarial process such as litigation or arbitration cannot.  No one faces “losing” to the other party.  This aspect is especially important when ongoing, long-term relationships are involved.</p>
				<p>Mediation is a dynamic field which requires a skilled professional to achieve optimal results.</p>
				<p>Mediations can be scheduled and completed much faster than litigation.  Studies indicate success rates ranging between 80% and 90% with equally high levels of satisfaction.</p>

				<h2>Facilitation</h2>
				<h4>Services Provided</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Consensus Building</li>
					<li>Problem-Solving</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A process in which an impartial third party (facilitator) works with a group by helping group members communicate and problem-solve productively, resulting in high quality decisions.  The facilitator provides structure so the group can address the content.</p>
				<p>Effective communication is the most critical component of any productive group discussion.  Facilitated meetings provide opportunities for all group members to actively participate in the discussion.  Facilitators use skills that provide opportunities for all participants to constructively express opinions and viewpoints.  They can draw out the quiet members of the group and manage disruptive behaviors.  Balance in a process is especially important when there are inequities in levels of authority, power, and/or influence.</p>  
				<p>Because our facilitators have no vested interest in the outcomes, we can help groups objectively define and frame issues for effective problem-solving.  A critical aspect of the facilitator's role is to help groups design processes to gather relevant information and develop criteria in order to generate and weigh multiple options, make decisions, and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented solutions.</p>
				<p>While conflict can destroy a group’s ability to function together, when appropriately managed, it can stimulate thinking and even energize the group.  Our facilitators are highly skilled in all aspects of conflict management to assist groups to effectively address differences so that conflict can be a constructive force in the group process.</p>

				<p>Coaching is a learning partnership for generating creative, purposeful action toward one person’s goals and desires.  It is an effective means to help people improve job performance, build leadership skills, and remove obstacles blocking their path to success.</p>
				<p>Coaching is a relationship between a coach and a willing individual that operates in an environment of respect, trust, safety, challenge and accountability.  Coaching is truly about one person helping another to excel.</p>
				<p>Working with a coach can provide energy and motivation to achieve the goals and specific outcomes that are important for success.  Utilizing a coach can be especially helpful when:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An individual has a style of relating or interacting that is ineffective or is not supporting the achievement of one’s personally relevant goals</li>
					<li>There is a gap in knowledge, skills, confidence, or resources</li>
					<li>There is something at stake (a challenge, stretch goal or opportunity), and it is urgent, compelling, exciting or all of the above</li>
					<li>There is a need for a course correction in work or life due to a setback</li>
					<li>There is a need to make career choices and a lack of clarity about what to do</li>
					<li>Work and life are out of balance, creating unwanted consequences</li>
					<li>There is a need and a desire to better organized and more self-managing</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The coach serves as an ally who non-judgmentally guides and supports the client in reaching his or her stated purpose and goals.  During coaching sessions, the coach is always present in service of the client.  The coach is there to challenge the person being coached to consider new perspectives and different approaches - to “stretch” beyond where they are today in a specific area or areas.</p>
				<p>The primary goal of the coach is to help the client achieve his or her goals in a way that, over time, reduces dependence on the coach.  The coaching process is focused on helping the client access both internal and external resources to draw upon in the future.</p>

				<p>In order to effectively address organizational needs, an organization must first understand the scope of the need   A consultant with specific expertise works with a client to identify the problem, recommend possible solutions/services, and identify available resources.  The objectivity of the consultant provides valuable insight.  By partnering with the client, the client is actively engaged in addressing organizational issues and conflicts, with the support of the consultant’s expertise.  The most frequent needs of organizations fall into these categories.</p>
