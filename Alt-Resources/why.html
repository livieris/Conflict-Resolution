				<h2>Get to the root of conflict's problem before setting action</h2>
				<p>Two members of our management team are at odds with each other and I don’t know what to do.  They have never worked together as effectively as I expect for people in their positions and, lately, things have gotten worse.  They only talk to each other when absolutely necessary and, instead, communicate through other managers and their subordinates. You could cut the tension with a knife at management team meetings when both are present.  Other managers avoid meetings or refrain from voicing their ideas because it’s often misinterpreted as taking sides.  As their director, I’ve met with each of them many times to try to fix the problem, but to no avail.  They blame each other or say it’s a personality conflict that can’t be fixed so the other person has to go.  Both managers are extremely valuable to this organization and I don’t want to lose either of them.  On the other hand, I need them to work together for long term success. What can I do?</p>
				<p>As a leader, you may believe you are expected to fix problems between team members.  This expectation may come from yourself, your superiors, or those whom you supervise.  In reality, however, many conflicts between people in the workplace are best resolved by those with the problem.  While you may be able to help them work things out, you must be careful about the role you play in doing so.  Ask yourself the following questions to become clear about the role you play in this situation.</p>
				<h3>Are you escalating the conflict?</h3>
				<p>As their director, when each of the managers comes to you separately you need to listen to their concerns.  However, what you say and do in those meetings may be misinterpreted as taking sides and you may be, inadvertently, fueling the fire.   In the future, let them know you’ve heard them by paraphrasing and summarizing their concerns.  Then insist that they meet with you together to jointly identify the problem and make decisions regarding the conflict between them.  Direct communication between them, in a neutral setting, is imperative to effectively addressing their conflict.</p>
				<h3>Do both managers understand your expectations of them and are you holding them accountable?</h3>
				<p>You say you expect people in their positions to work together effectively, but is that truly the message they’re getting?  Their refusal to talk to each other negatively impacts the productivity and effectiveness of the departments they manage.  Their behavior in management team meetings creates problems for managers and the management team as a whole.  They are modeling misbehavior for their subordinates.  Yet, their inappropriate behavior continues.  It’s time to meet with them together to clarify your expectations and to give them clear consequences if they don’t meet those expectations.</p>
				<h3>What other help can you offer them?</h3>
				<p>As the director, you may be too close to the situation and too vested in the outcome to be effective, or your relationship with either party may inhibit your ability to help them work out their differences.  Perhaps someone from Human Resources, or another director that they both respect, could assist your managers.  Or, consider an outside organization that specializes in helping people resolve workplace conflict.  Outside assistance can be especially helpful when:  trust levels within an organization are low; there is a real or perceived conflict of interest with internal assistance; or conflict management skills within the organization are not adequate for the level of conflict.</p>
				<p>When it comes to conflict between those you manage, if you can't get out of the middle it's often best to get out of the way.</p>

				<h2>Improving your listening skills certain to reduce mistakes</h2>
				<p>I have been making more than my share of mistakes lately and my boss is really getting on my case.  I think that I understand the directions that people are giving me, but when I give them the final work product it seems that I’ve missed something or have not completed the task as they expected.  It looks to me like most of my mistakes happen when I get verbal directions for what I am expected to do and the person giving them to me is in a hurry.  We’ve become extremely busy in the last year and the pace has really picked up for all of us.  My boss says that the mistakes are my fault because I’m not a good listener.  How can I become a better listener when it seems like we’re always in a rush?</p>
				<p>It could be said that most workers receive half of their paycheck for listening but many of us can’t say that we are always good listeners.  In fact, poor listening can be cited as the cause for many costly mistakes in the workplace.  We may hear with our ears but listening requires far more than our auditory systems to be in working order.  Good listening doesn’t just happen – it takes skill building and effort.  Try these tips to improve your listening.</p>
				<h3>Prepare to actively listen</h3>
				<p>Effective listening requires your full attention.  Eliminate distractions (internal and external) and avoid interruptions.  Get away from the computer and put aside the work on your desk.  Find a quiet, private place in which to have important conversations or to get complex directions.  Spending a few more minutes up front will save you many frustrations, as well as the time that now gets wasted on fixing mistakes.</p>
				<h3>Allow the speaker to finish before formulating your response</h3>
				<p>The single, biggest cause of poor listening is the failure to really concentrate on what the other person is saying.  Listening means trying to see the situation the way the speaker sees it and you can’t do this while formulating your questions or rehearsing in your mind what you are going to say next. Waiting to hear the entire message without interrupting allows the speaker to stay focused, eliminating missed instructions and unnecessary questions.</p>
				<h3>Take notes</h3>
				<p>Most people remember only a small amount of what they hear within a short time after hearing it.  Note-taking is an excellent listening tool, especially when you are given numerous or complex directions.  When you take notes, you can listen without interruption while creating a reference tool for clarifying the instructions being given and the expected work product.  You also demonstrate your commitment to quality and accuracy in your work.</p>
				<h3>Take time to clarify what you have heard</h3>
				<p>Restate, in your own words, your understanding of the instructions that you are being given.  This slows the pace of interaction, allows the speaker to clarify misunderstandings and helps to draw out more information.  Then you can ask appropriate questions to fill in any gaps.</p>
				<h3>Build your listening skills with training</h3>
				<p>Much of the education that we receive about communication throughout life focuses on speaking not listening.  Sign up for a workshop or encourage your employer to provide some in-house training so that everyone can improve their listening skills.  Look for training that provides the opportunity to practice the skills you are learning, with feedback, to ensure good learning.  And then make sure to apply your new skills at every opportunity – remember, “Practice makes perfect”.</p>
				<p>Become a better listener and watch your mistakes decline and your productivity improve!</p>

				<h2>Improve Your Workplace Environment</h2>
				<p>Find yourself dreading going to work because there seems to be a black cloud hanging over the place?  If you love your job but hate going to work, your only option isn’t to find a different job.  You and your co-workers really do have some control over the quality of your workplace environment.  Start a campaign to make your workplace more enjoyable with these tips.</p>
				<h3>Check your attitude</h3>
				<p>about yourself, your workplace, and the people you work with and for.  Change starts with you, so make an attitude adjustment if one is in order.  Any work can be done cheerfully or begrudgingly; how we do our work greatly impacts our workplace environment.</p>
				<h3>Share openly about your area of responsibility and your role</h3>
				<p>What you do and how you do it impacts other employee’s roles and responsibilities in some way.  Information is power; share it.</p>
				<h3>Be open to other ideas and actively solicit input</h3>
				<p>Respect the dignity and competency of everyone in your workplace by asking others to share their thoughts and ideas. Each person offers a unique perspective and you will give the message that you value your co-workers as important team members.</p>
				<h3>Give appropriate feedback in a timely way</h3>
				<p>Be generous with praise and positive reinforcement for positive results.  Empower and energize yourself and others through the use of positive words.  Build upon what is working well.  When improvement is necessary, critique the behavior not the person.</p>
				<h3>Avoid infecting others with workplace politics</h3>
				<p>Sharing gossip and venting inappropriately create divisions.  Give each person the freedom to make individual assessments and form their own opinions without your personal judgments. </p>
				<p>You have the power to positively influence your workplace environment</p>

				<h2>Managing Change</h2>
				<p>Change is inevitable, Survival in today's global economy requires organizations to 
				be flexible and adapt readily to the ever-changing marketplace. The oft-heard 
				rallying cry in today's organizations is "Change or die." No one is untouched by 
				change.</p>
				<p>Collective organizational change is a multifaceted process that occurs only when the 
				forces that promote the change have successfully addressed resistance to it. 
				Because an organization's need for change often conflicts with its members' need to 
				maintain their sense of personal security, people and organizations naturally tend 
				to resist change. Today, it is as necessary for organizations to pay as much 
				attention to the psychological and social aspects of change as they do to the 
				technological aspects. Change can be anxiety producing and stressful because it 
				creates a fear of the unknown. A clear understanding of the need for and benefits of 
				the change will reduce fears and increase acceptance. </p>
				<p>Change is something that people do, not something that is done to them, 
				Successful organizations foster a positive attitude toward change by anticipating 
				and purposefully planning for it. Just as implementing an organizational change is 
				a process, so it is with individual acceptance of change. Change must be addressed 
				in an intentional, goal-oriented manner that includes open communication and joint 
				problem solving. Involvement in planning and implementing change helps people 
				maintain a sense of control and increases their buy-in, resulting in a successful 
				change process.</p>
				<h3>Economics of effective change management</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Minimize noncompliance</li>
					<li>maintain/increase productivity</li>
					<li>Active engagement in change process</li>
					<li>Avoid internal undermining and sabotage</li>
					<li>Maintain positive emotional and phyical health</li>
					<li>Positive corporate image</li>
					<li>Employee retention</li>

				<h2>Use Mediation Skills to Address Workplace Conflict</h2>
				<p>Got conflict at work but don’t have access to a mediator?  In many conflict situations, you can use the same skills that mediators use to help yourself and others work together to resolve conflict and reach mutually satisfactory solutions.</p>
				<h3>Start with an "I Message"</h3>
				<p>When confronting someone about a problem, be assertive and speak in terms of how the person’s action affects you on a personal level.  You can also use an “I” message, such as “I’m unclear about...,” to get others to say more about what’s bothering them.</p>
				<h3>"Reframe" the message</h3>
				<p>Change the tone of the message from negative to positive, allowing the recipient to really hear the message rather than getting defensive.   Reframing can change a person’s perception of a message because you suspend judgment while avoiding placing blame and making assumptions.</p>
				<h3>Ask open-ended, neutral questions</h3>
				<p>If you are truly interested in understanding another’s point of view, you need to create an environment that encourages people to speak freely.  Encourage dialogue through open-ended questions that allow parties to frame their own responses and emphasize what is important from their perspectives.  Avoid pointed questions and implied judgments in your language and/or tone of voice.</p>
				<h3>Restate what you've heard</h3>
				<p>Paraphrasing lets others know you are trying to understand, clarifies communication, slows the pace of interaction, reduces intensity, and helps to draw out more information.  It is important to paraphrase what you have heard before giving your point of view.</p>
				<h3>Encourage open expression of feelings</h3>
				<p>Emotions provide clues to important information such as why someone is responding in a particular way or what motivates us and others.</p>

				<h2>We Get What We Expect</h2>
				<p>Working with someone who always seems to see the glass half empty?  It’s easy to label that person as a chronic complainer.  Work relationships often become self-fulfilling prophecies because we create expectations of people—positive or negative—based on our labels.  Then we treat them accordingly.  Here are some things you can do to deal effectively with your co-worker instead of assigning a label.</p>
				<h3>Follow the golden rule</h3>
				<p>Treat your co-worker as you’d like to be treated.  Make an effort to be pleasant and respectful—smile.  Be equally considerate of all co-worker’s needs.</p>
				<h3>Check your attitude</h3>
				<p>Is it really “complaining” or do you just hear everything this co-worker says as a complaint?  If you hear “It’s raining again” from this person does it sound like a complaint, while you would hear the same remark from another co-worker as a simple comment about the weather?  Is your attitude based on what you’ve heard or your own experience?  A negative attitude results in negative behavior that will likely be reciprocated.</p>
				<h3>Recognize the difference between a complaint and a legitimage concern</h3>
				<p>Raising legitimate issues is not complaining. Legitimage issues can be problem-solved; complaints can't.</p>
				<h3>Be caregul about scapegoating</h3>
				<p>Outspoken people are easy targets for those who want to stay under the radar for their own reasons.  Take care to not use labeling as a diversion tactic to avoid addressing problems.</p>
				<h3>Set boundaries</h3>
				<p>You can’t change anyone who truly is a chronic complainer, but you needn’t be the sounding board.  Help find the appropriate place to direct complaints.  Then respectfully decline to listen to similar grumbling in the future.</p>
				<p>Labels are for food, not people.</p>
