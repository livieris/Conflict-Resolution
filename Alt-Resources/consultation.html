			<h3>Needs Assessment</h3>
				<p>The objective of a Needs Assessment is to assets the overall workplace environment/climate as it relates to managing communication, conflict, and change for effective teamwork.  Information is	gathered confidentially and individually and is used to pinpoint and highlight opportunities for improvement, identify issues and concerns, determine appropriate responses to address issues, and determine the necessary parties for participation in recommended processes.  A written report of the findings and recommendations is presented. </p>
				<h3>Facilitating Change</h3>
				<p>Change is something that people do, not something that is done to them.  Successful organizations anticipate and purposefully plan for it.  Just as	implementing an organizational change is a process,	so it is with individual acceptance of change.  Change	must be addressed in an intentional, goal-oriented manner that includes ongoing open communication,	joint problem solving, and appropriate resources. Involvement in planning and implementing	change helps people maintain a sense of control, reduces fears and increases their buy-in, resulting in	a successful change process.</p>
				<h3>Team Building</h3>
				<p>Cohesive teams are the cornerstone of successful organizations.  In order to achieve its’ goals and objectives, an organization must have people who	trust in one another’s’ capabilities and motives. Effective teams demonstrate good communication, coordination and cooperation. Individual and collective accountability is a given.  Purposeful efforts must be made to prepare a group of people to function as a team—appropriate technical, problem - solving and communication skills must be developed.</p>
				<h3>External Support Services</h3>
				<p>Services and support for issues involving parties outside the organization such as clients, vendors, and customers.  Materials include process guides, tips, and newsletter articles.</p>
